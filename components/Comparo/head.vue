          available between sessions, during which you have to review your
          video/data, along with a whole host of other things. That is why we
          have made our video data analysis software so simple to use.</em

        Although we believe Comparo HD is the simplest video data logging
        software on the market, to some we appreciate it may appear daunting at
        first glance, due to all the text, graphs and buttons. That is why we
        actively encourage you to download a copy of Comparo HD for free, along
        with some sample video/data and have a go at comparing laps and
        analysing data for yourself.
        <br />
        <br />
        Comparo HD is Race-Keepers video data analysis software which plays
        synchronized video alongside course map and data traces, including
        speed, lap number, lap time, G forces, as well as any other data streams
        available via OBD-II, ECU/CAN or from Analog/Digital sensors.
        <br />
        <br />
        It presents all of this information in a single, combined view so that
        you can instantly start analysing your ontrack performance straight
        away. Data and video is automatically syncronised so there is no
        unnecessary setup or configuring that is required before you can
        playback your outing.
