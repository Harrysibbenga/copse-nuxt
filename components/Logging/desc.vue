        <strong>Road-Keeper</strong> The Ultimate Video and data Logging System
        for road cars, race cars, off-road racers, race boats, helicopters,
        aeroplanes, and anything else that goes fast and tears it up!
      </h1>
      <p>
        Road-Keeper is the worlds most cost effective multi-camera 1080p HD
        video data logger and it’s available now in the Race-Keeper store.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our latest innovation in video data systems is the Trivinci Road-Keeper
        system for recording dual stream 1080p full HD video and audio along
        with GPS and accelerometer data. Road-Keeper is fully compatible with
        our Race-Keeper Comparo video data analysis application; this will allow
        you to use the same applications that the Pros use for reviewing,
        analyzing, comparing and exporting video and data from your video data
        logger.
        <br />
        <br />
        Use Road-Keeper on the road or at the track – the cyclic logging will
        ensure you always capture the latest action no matter where it happens.
        Never worry about deleting old videos, they will be automatically
        overwritten when space is needed.
        <br />
        <br />
        The compact unit contains both 1080p HD cameras, GPS, accelerometers,
        and status screen. This allows for a very fast, secure, and stealthy
        installation in your vehicle.
        <br />
        <br />
        Both cameras can be adjusted vertically and horizontally to capture the
        perfect view. The top camera captures the interior view while the lower
        camera looks forward to capture the road ahead. In-car audio is recorded
        onto both of the video streams, the microphone can be muted for privacy
        by pressing the Mic button on your Road-Keeper.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Road Keeper kit includes a 32GB micro SD card with an SD card
        adapter, for recording all the action around and in your vehicle on the
        race track and on the road.
